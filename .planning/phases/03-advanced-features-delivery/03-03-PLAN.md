<objective>
Create presentation materials for class: a slide outline and a rehearsable demo script.

Purpose: The class presentation is the culmination of this project. Slides provide structure and context. The demo script ensures the live demo runs smoothly and communicates technical depth through conversational explanation. These materials turn code into a compelling story about learning Solana.

Output: docs/PRESENTATION.md (slide outline with speaker notes) + docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md (chapter-based demo script with exact commands).

  <name>Task 1: Create presentation slide outline with speaker notes</name>
  <files>docs/PRESENTATION.md</files>
  <action>
    Create `docs/PRESENTATION.md` - a slide-by-slide outline for a ~15 minute class presentation (10 minutes presentation + 5 minutes Q&A).

    This is NOT a PowerPoint file. It's a markdown outline that can be used as-is for speaking notes, or converted to slides in any tool (Google Slides, reveal.js, Keynote). Keep slide content minimal (2026 standard: large fonts, few words per slide, let the speaker fill in).

    **Presentation metadata at top:**
    - Title: Memecoin Factory: Security-First Token Creation on Solana
    - Duration: 15 minutes (10 presentation + 5 Q&A)
    - Audience: Computer science classmates
    - Format: 5-7 slides + live terminal demo
    - Companion: See DEMO_SCRIPT.md for live demo instructions

    **Slide 1: Title (30 seconds)**
    - Content: Project name, one-line tagline, your name
    - Speaker notes: Brief intro - "Today I'm showing you a tool I built for creating secure tokens on Solana"

    **Slide 2: The Problem (2 minutes)**
    - Content: "Most token tutorials skip security" with a visual showing active vs revoked authorities
    - Speaker notes: Explain rug pull concept - active mint authority means creator can print unlimited tokens. Show concept of authority status (active = dangerous, revoked = safe). This is the core motivation.
    - Key point: Make audience understand WHY this matters before showing HOW you solved it

    **Slide 3: The Solution (2 minutes)**
    - Content: Simple architecture diagram (text boxes showing: CLI -> Token Creation -> Authority Revocation -> Metadata -> Burn)
    - Speaker notes: "My tool makes security the default. When you create a token, authorities are automatically revoked. No checkbox, no option - it just happens." Briefly mention the three features: creation with revocation, professional metadata via IPFS/Metaplex, and burn mechanism.
    - Key point: Security by design, not by choice

    **Slide 4: Live Demo Transition (10 seconds)**
    - Content: "Let me show you" (or "Live Demo")
    - Speaker notes: Switch to terminal. See DEMO_SCRIPT.md for exact commands. This is the main event - 5-7 minutes of live demo.

    **Slide 5: What I Learned (2 minutes)**
    - Content: 3-4 bullet points of key learning outcomes
    - Speaker notes: This is the most important slide for a class presentation. Demonstrate UNDERSTANDING, not just coding ability.
      1. Solana's account model is fundamentally different from Ethereum (wallets don't hold tokens directly, ATAs do)
      2. Security must be structural, not behavioral (users forget to check boxes, frameworks enforce defaults)
      3. Token metadata lives in a separate program (Metaplex) - tokens are just numbers without it
      4. Decentralized storage (IPFS) solves the "who hosts the logo" problem permanently
    - Key point: Show you learned concepts, not just syntax

    **Slide 6: Future Enhancements (30 seconds, optional)**
    - Content: 2-3 possible extensions
    - Speaker notes: Mention briefly if time allows: Raydium liquidity pool creation, web UI, Token-2022 features, mainnet deployment. Shows you understand the broader ecosystem.

    **Slide 7: Questions (Q&A)**
    - Content: "Questions?" with project repo link
    - Speaker notes: Prepared answers for likely questions (see Q&A prep section below)

    **Q&A Preparation section (not a slide, just notes):**
    - "Why devnet instead of mainnet?" - Zero cost, safe for learning. Code is mainnet-ready, just change cluster parameter.
    - "Why CLI instead of a web app?" - CLI demonstrates core concepts without frontend complexity. Timeline constraint (<2 weeks).
    - "Could someone undo the authority revocation?" - No, that's the point. Setting to null is permanent at the protocol level.
    - "What happens if IPFS goes down?" - Content-addressed, replicated across nodes. As long as one node has it, it's accessible.
    - "How much does it cost?" - About 0.0015 SOL on devnet (free). Same cost on mainnet (~$0.20 at current prices).
    - "What about Token-2022?" - Token-2022 adds features like transfer fees, but classic SPL tokens have universal wallet/DEX support.

    Design guidance notes at bottom:
    - Minimum font size: 24pt (readable on projectors)
    - Maximum words per slide: 20-30
    - Use high contrast (light text on dark background works well for code)
    - Code snippets: maximum 5 lines per slide, larger font than regular text

  <files>docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md</files>
  <action>
    Create `docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md` - a rehearsable, chapter-based script for the live demo portion of the presentation (5-7 minutes).

    This is the single most important deliverable for the presentation. A well-rehearsed demo is the difference between "cool project" and "this person really understands Solana."

    **Header:**
    - Title: Live Demo Script
    - Duration: 5-7 minutes
    - Prerequisites checklist (run before class)
    - Environment setup instructions

    **Pre-Demo Checklist:**
    - [ ] Terminal window open, large font (minimum 18pt, ideally 24pt)
    - [ ] Wallet funded with at least 2 SOL on devnet (`solana balance --url devnet`)
    - [ ] If balance low: `solana airdrop 2 --url devnet`
    - [ ] PINATA_JWT environment variable set (for metadata demo)
    - [ ] Test token logo image ready (any small PNG/JPG file)
    - [ ] Tool builds successfully: `npm run build`
    - [ ] Quick test: `npm run dev -- create --dry-run` works
    - [ ] Browser tab open to Solana Explorer (explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet)
    - [ ] Backup video recorded (just in case)
    - [ ] These notes open on second screen or printed

    **Chapter 1: Create a Token (3 minutes)**

    Talking point: "Let me create a token right now on Solana's devnet..."

    ```
    npm run dev -- create
    ```

    As prompts appear, narrate:
    - Token name prompt: "I'll call this DemoToken. Names can be 1-32 characters."
    - Symbol prompt: "DEMO. This is what shows up in wallets."
    - Decimals prompt: "9 decimals, same as SOL. This means the smallest unit is 0.000000001."
    - Supply prompt: "1 million tokens. This gets multiplied by 10^9 internally - that's how Solana handles precision."
    - Description prompt: "A quick description for wallet display."
    - Image prompt: "[provide path to test image] This uploads to IPFS for permanent storage."

    Pause at cost estimate: "See the cost breakdown? About 0.0015 SOL for rent exemption. Solana accounts need a SOL deposit to exist - it's an anti-spam mechanism called rent exemption."

    After creation: "Notice the educational messages? While uploading to IPFS, it explains what IPFS does. This is a learning tool, not just automation."

    Key moment - point out authorities: "Look at the Authority Dashboard. Mint authority: REVOKED. Freeze authority: REVOKED. This token's supply is permanently fixed. Even I can't change it now."

    Open Explorer link: "Let's verify on Solana Explorer... [click link]. There - you can see the token, its metadata, and the null authorities."

    **Chapter 2: Burn Tokens (2 minutes)**

    Talking point: "Now let's demonstrate the deflationary mechanism - burning tokens..."

    ```
    npm run dev -- burn --mint <PASTE_MINT_ADDRESS_FROM_STEP_1> --amount 1000
    ```

    Narrate the confirmation flow: "Notice the three-level confirmation? First a warning, then type BURN, then final yes/no. This follows UX best practices - friction should scale with irreversibility."

    After burn: "Supply decreased from 1,000,000 to 999,000. We verify this on-chain. Those 1000 tokens are permanently gone."

    **Chapter 3: Dry-Run Mode (1 minute, if time allows)**

    Talking point: "What if you want to preview without spending SOL?"

    ```
    npm run dev -- create --dry-run --name "Test" --symbol "TST"
    ```

    "Dry-run shows every operation that WOULD happen, with cost estimates, but makes zero blockchain calls. Good for learning and testing."

    **Timing Notes:**
    - If running behind: Skip Chapter 3 entirely
    - If running ahead: Show authority dashboard in more detail, open multiple Explorer links
    - If demo fails: Switch to backup plan (below)

    **Backup Plan (if demo fails):**

    Scenario 1: "Insufficient funds"
    - Fix: `solana airdrop 2 --url devnet` (takes 5 seconds)
    - Say: "Even this error is educational - let me show you how devnet airdrops work"

    Scenario 2: "Network timeout"
    - Fix: Try once more, if still fails switch to backup
    - Say: "Devnet can be unstable - that's why we always test on devnet before mainnet"

    Scenario 3: Terminal/tool won't start
    - Use backup: Show pre-recorded terminal video or screenshots
    - Say: "I have a recording from my last test run - let me walk you through it"

    Scenario 4: IPFS/Pinata fails
    - Fix: Skip metadata, create without --image
    - Say: "The token still works without metadata - logos are optional. Let me show the core creation..."

    **Post-Demo Transition:**
    - "That's the tool in action. Let me switch back to slides and talk about what building this taught me..."
    - Switch to Slide 5 (What I Learned)

    **Rehearsal Notes at bottom:**
    - Practice the full demo at least twice before presentation
    - Time yourself - target 5 minutes for Chapters 1-2
    - Have the mint address from Chapter 1 ready to paste into Chapter 2 (keep it visible)
    - Practice the backup plan once so it feels natural if needed
    - Speak slowly during key moments (cost estimate, authority dashboard, burn confirmation)
